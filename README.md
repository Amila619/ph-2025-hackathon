* A coconut farmer in Galle lists coconuts for sale.
* A coconut oil factory in Colombo sees it and buys directly.

* Factory uses platform to analyze profit and gets a suggestion to **reduce transport cost**.
* Farmer gets more income → business saves cost → more jobs created → **poverty reduced**.

* “Your employee-to-production ratio is too high. Reduce by 1 worker.”
