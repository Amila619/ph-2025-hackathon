# OTP-Based Registration Process Fix

## Problem
The registration process was not working because of a mismatch between frontend and backend expectations:

### Frontend (Signup.page.jsx)
- Was sending: `{ name, email, password }`

### Backend (auth.controller.js & auth.service.js)
- Was expecting: `{ universityMail }` only
- Not handling name or additional registration data

## Solution - OTP-Based Authentication

The application uses **OTP (One-Time Password) based authentication** for both registration and login, eliminating the need for password management.

### Backend Changes

#### 1. **auth.controller.js** - Updated `register` function
- Now accepts `email` and `name` from request body (NO PASSWORD)
- Added validation for required fields
- Generates OTP using `Crypto.randomBytes(4).toString('hex')`
- Stores OTP in Redis with 5-minute expiration
- Sends OTP to user's email via `sendEmail` service
- Returns user object and success message

#### 2. **auth.service.js** - Updated `registerUser` function
- Now accepts two parameters: `email` and `name` (NO PASSWORD)
- Removed bcrypt import and password hashing
- Checks for existing users by both `universityMail` and `contact.email`
- Stores user with:
  - `universityMail`: normalized email
  - `contact.email`: normalized email
  - `name.fname`: first part of name
  - `name.lname`: rest of name
- No password_hash field (OTP-based auth only)
- Returns complete user object

### Frontend Changes

#### 3. **Signup.page.jsx** - Updated for OTP flow
- **Removed**: All password-related fields (password, confirm password)
- **Removed**: `LockOutlined` icon import
- Added informational message: "ðŸ“§ We'll send a verification code to your email"
- Updated to send only `{ name, email }` to backend
- Stores user data in localStorage as 'pendingUser' after registration
- Redirects to `/verify-otp` page with success message
- Uses toast notifications for user feedback

#### 4. **VerifyOtp.page.jsx** - Enhanced for registration flow
- Now checks for user from both:
  - Navigation state (login flow)
  - localStorage 'pendingUser' (registration flow)
- Clears 'pendingUser' from localStorage after successful verification
- Handles OTP verification for both registration and login

## Registration & Login Flow

### Registration Flow:
```
1. User enters: Name, Email
   â†“
2. Frontend sends { name, email } to /api/auth/register
   â†“
3. Backend validates fields
   â†“
4. Check if user already exists
   â†“
5. Create new user (no password)
   â†“
6. Generate 8-character hex OTP
   â†“
7. Store OTP in Redis (5-minute expiry)
   â†“
8. Send OTP to user's email
   â†“
9. Return user object
   â†“
10. Frontend stores user in localStorage
    â†“
11. Redirect to /verify-otp page
    â†“
12. User enters OTP from email
    â†“
13. Backend verifies OTP from Redis
    â†“
14. Generate JWT access & refresh tokens
    â†“
15. Clear OTP from Redis
    â†“
16. Return tokens and user data
    â†“
17. Frontend saves token and redirects to dashboard
```

### Login Flow:
```
1. User enters: Email only
   â†“
2. Backend finds user by email
   â†“
3. Generate OTP and store in Redis
   â†“
4. Send OTP to user's email
   â†“
5. User enters OTP
   â†“
6. Backend verifies and issues JWT tokens
   â†“
7. User logged in and redirected to dashboard
```

## Database Schema
User is stored with:
```javascript
{
  universityMail: "user@example.com",
  contact: {
    email: "user@example.com"
  },
  name: {
    fname: "John",
    lname: "Doe"
  },
  role: "user", // default
  isPremium: false, // default
  isWelfareReciever: false, // default
  // NO password_hash field - OTP auth only
}
```

## Dependencies
- **crypto**: Node.js built-in (for OTP generation)
- **redis**: For temporary OTP storage (v5.8.3)
- **nodemailer**: For sending OTP emails (v7.0.9)
- **react-toastify**: For frontend notifications (v11.0.5)

## Security Features
- âœ… No passwords to manage or compromise
- âœ… OTP expires after 5 minutes
- âœ… OTP stored in Redis (memory, auto-expires)
- âœ… OTP deleted immediately after successful verification
- âœ… Email normalized and deduplicated
- âœ… JWT tokens for session management
- âœ… Refresh token in HTTP-only cookie

## Testing
1. Fill out registration form with name and email (no password!)
2. Click "Sign Up"
3. Should see success toast: "Registration successful! Please check your email for OTP"
4. Check email for 8-character OTP code
5. Enter OTP on verification page
6. Should be logged in and redirected to dashboard
