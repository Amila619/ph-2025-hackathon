# Update and Delete Operations Fix with Toast Messages

## Overview
Fixed delete functionality for products and services and replaced all Ant Design `message` notifications with `react-toastify` toast messages for update and delete operations.

---

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Delete Operations Not Working**
**Problem**: Delete confirmation modal's `onOk` callback was not properly handling the async delete function.

**Root Cause**: The `onOk` callback was not async, causing the promise to not be properly awaited.

**Solution**: Made the `onOk` callbacks async and properly await the delete functions.

---

### 2. **Using Ant Design Messages Instead of Toast**
**Problem**: Update and delete operations were using Ant Design's `message` component instead of `react-toastify`.

**Solution**: Replaced all `message.success()` and `message.error()` calls with `toast.success()` and `toast.error()` for consistency.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Delete Product Handler

**Before:**
```javascript
const handleDeleteProduct = (product) => {
    Modal.confirm({
        title: 'Delete Product',
        content: `Are you sure you want to delete "${product.name}"?`,
        okText: 'Delete',
        okType: 'danger',
        onOk: () => deleteProduct(product._id)  // ❌ Not async
    });
};
```

**After:**
```javascript
const handleDeleteProduct = (product) => {
    Modal.confirm({
        title: 'Delete Product',
        content: `Are you sure you want to delete "${product.name}"?`,
        okText: 'Delete',
        okType: 'danger',
        cancelText: 'Cancel',
        onOk: async () => {  // ✅ Now async
            await deleteProduct(product._id);
        }
    });
};
```

**Changes:**
- ✅ Made `onOk` callback async
- ✅ Added `await` for proper promise handling
- ✅ Added `cancelText` for clarity

---

### 2. Delete Service Handler

**Before:**
```javascript
const handleDeleteService = (service) => {
    Modal.confirm({
        title: 'Delete Service',
        content: `Are you sure you want to delete "${service.s_category}"?`,
        okText: 'Delete',
        okType: 'danger',
        onOk: () => deleteService(service._id)  // ❌ Not async
    });
};
```

**After:**
```javascript
const handleDeleteService = (service) => {
    Modal.confirm({
        title: 'Delete Service',
        content: `Are you sure you want to delete "${service.s_category}"?`,
        okText: 'Delete',
        okType: 'danger',
        cancelText: 'Cancel',
        onOk: async () => {  // ✅ Now async
            await deleteService(service._id);
        }
    });
};
```

**Changes:**
- ✅ Made `onOk` callback async
- ✅ Added `await` for proper promise handling
- ✅ Added `cancelText` for clarity

---

### 3. Update Product Function

**Before:**
```javascript
const updateProduct = async (id, values) => {
    try {
        await AxiosInstance.put(`/products/${id}`, values);
        // ... update state
        message.success('Product updated successfully!');  // ❌ Ant Design message
    } catch (error) {
        message.error('Failed to update product: ' + error.message);  // ❌ Ant Design message
    }
};
```

**After:**
```javascript
const updateProduct = async (id, values) => {
    try {
        await AxiosInstance.put(`/products/${id}`, values);
        // ... update state
        
        toast.success('Product updated successfully!', {  // ✅ Toast notification
            position: 'top-right',
            autoClose: 3000
        });
    } catch (error) {
        toast.error('Failed to update product: ' + (error.response?.data?.message || error.message), {  // ✅ Toast notification
            position: 'top-right',
            autoClose: 5000
        });
    }
};
```

**Changes:**
- ✅ Replaced `message.success()` with `toast.success()`
- ✅ Replaced `message.error()` with `toast.error()`
- ✅ Added position and autoClose configuration
- ✅ Success toasts auto-close after 3 seconds

    } catch (error) {
        message.error('Failed to delete product: ' + error.message);  // ❌ Ant Design message
    }
};
```

## User Experience Flow

### Updating a Product

1. **User clicks "Edit" on a product**
   - Edit modal opens with pre-filled form
   
2. **User makes changes and clicks "Update Product"**
   - API request sent to backend
   
3. **Success scenario:**
   - ✅ Product updated in database
   - ✅ Product list refreshed
   - ✅ Green toast appears: "Product updated successfully!" (3 seconds)
   - ✅ Modal closes automatically
   - ✅ Form fields reset

4. **Error scenario:**
   - ❌ Red toast appears: "Failed to update product: [error message]" (5 seconds)
   - ❌ Modal remains open
   - ❌ User can retry or cancel

---

### Deleting a Product

1. **User clicks "Delete" on a product**
   - Confirmation modal appears: "Are you sure you want to delete '[Product Name]'?"
   - Shows "Delete" and "Cancel" buttons
   
2. **User clicks "Delete" to confirm**
   - API request sent to backend
   - Modal shows loading state (Ant Design default)
   
3. **Success scenario:**
   - ✅ Product deleted from database
   - ✅ Product list refreshed (item removed from UI)
   - ✅ Green toast appears: "Product deleted successfully!" (3 seconds)
   - ✅ Confirmation modal closes

4. **Error scenario:**
   - ❌ Red toast appears: "Failed to delete product: [error message]" (5 seconds)
   - ❌ Product remains in list
   - ❌ Confirmation modal closes
   - ❌ User can try again

5. **User clicks "Cancel"**

   - No action taken

---

### Updating a Service

Same flow as product update:
- Edit button → Modal → Change fields → Update button → Toast notification

---

### Deleting a Service

Same flow as product delete:
- Delete button → Confirmation → Delete confirmation → Toast notification

---

## Toast Configuration

### Success Toasts (Green)
```javascript
toast.success('Operation successful!', {
    position: 'top-right',
    autoClose: 3000  // 3 seconds
});
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Green background
- ✅ Positioned in top-right corner
- ✅ Auto-dismiss after 3 seconds
- ✅ Can be closed manually with X button
- ✅ Shows checkmark icon

### Error Toasts (Red)
```javascript
toast.error('Operation failed: error message', {
    position: 'top-right',
    autoClose: 5000  // 5 seconds - more time to read
});
```

**Features:**
- ❌ Red background
- ❌ Positioned in top-right corner
- ❌ Auto-dismiss after 5 seconds (longer for errors)
- ❌ Can be closed manually with X button

## Comparison: Before vs After

### Delete Operations

**Before:**
```
User clicks "Delete" → Confirmation modal
User confirms → onOk: () => deleteProduct(id)  ❌ Not awaited
→ Modal closes immediately
→ No notification
→ Item might not be deleted
```

**After:**
```
User clicks "Delete" → Confirmation modal
User confirms → onOk: async () => await deleteProduct(id)  ✅ Properly awaited
→ Modal shows loading
→ Delete completes
→ Green toast: "Product deleted successfully!"
→ Modal closes
→ Item removed from list
```

### Update Operations

**Before:**
```
Update completes
→ message.success() ❌ Small Ant Design message in corner
→ Easy to miss
→ Different style from other notifications
```

**After:**
```
Update completes
→ toast.success() ✅ Prominent toast in top-right
→ Consistent with all notifications
→ Professional appearance
→ Auto-dismiss after 3 seconds
```

---

## Technical Details

### Why Async/Await Matters in Modal.confirm

Ant Design's `Modal.confirm` supports async `onOk` callbacks. When you make the callback async and return a promise (via `await`), the modal:

1. **Shows Loading State**: OK button shows spinning icon
2. **Waits for Completion**: Modal doesn't close until promise resolves
3. **Handles Errors**: If promise rejects, modal stays open
4. **Better UX**: User knows operation is in progress

**Before (Broken):**
```javascript
onOk: () => deleteProduct(id)
// Returns promise but modal doesn't wait for it
// Modal closes immediately
```

**After (Fixed):**
```javascript
onOk: async () => {
    await deleteProduct(id);
}
// Modal waits for promise to resolve
// Shows loading state
// Closes after completion
```
